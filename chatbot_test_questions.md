Notes:
- These test questions are designed to cover typical student queries. If the bot still returns incorrect/irrelevant answers, tell me which exact question produced the wrong answer and I'll expand or correct the KB and matching rules.
- Next step I can: add these as explicit Q/A entries (more than 30 each) into the knowledge base JSON, and add a small browser console test runner (optional). Request that and I will implement it.
