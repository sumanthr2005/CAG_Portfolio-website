    <h2>Activity 3: OTEC Power System</h2>
    <div class="diagram">

    </div>
    <p>
        Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) utilizes the temperature difference between warm surface seawater and cold deep seawater to generate electricity. The provided diagram represents a <b>closed-cycle OTEC system</b>, where a working fluid such as ammonia circulates within a sealed system. Warm seawater evaporates the fluid in an <b>evaporator</b>, the vapor drives a <b>turbine-generator</b> to produce electricity, and then cold deep seawater condenses the vapor back into liquid form, completing the cycle.
    </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Working Principle:</b> The continuous cycle of evaporation and condensation based on the ocean’s thermal gradient ensures steady power generation. The minimum temperature difference required is about 20°C between the surface and deep seawater layers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Advantages:</b> Continuous 24/7 operation, renewable and clean energy source, and potential for combined freshwater and hydrogen production. <br>
        <b>Disadvantages:</b> High capital cost, complex underwater infrastructure, and location constraints (requires tropical regions with stable temperature gradients).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Site Selection Criteria:</b> Best suited for tropical coastal regions where surface water temperatures are around 25–30°C and deep-water temperatures are about 5°C. Examples include areas near Hawaii, India, and the Caribbean.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Applications:</b> Apart from electricity generation, OTEC systems can provide <b>desalinated freshwater</b>, <b>cold seawater air-conditioning (SWAC)</b>, and support aquaculture. It holds promise for sustainable island and coastal community development.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenging Questions & Answers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Q1:</b> What are the main thermodynamic limitations in achieving high efficiency in OTEC systems?<br>
          <b>A1:</b> Since the temperature difference is small (typically 20°C), the Carnot efficiency is limited to about 6–7%. This requires large working fluid volumes and heat exchangers to maintain viable output.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Q2:</b> How can deep seawater pipe designs be optimized?<br>
          <b>A2:</b> Lightweight composite pipes with flexible joints and optimized hydrodynamic shape reduce frictional losses and structural stress, improving cold-water delivery efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Q3:</b> What factors influence the selection of working fluids in closed-cycle OTEC systems?<br>
          <b>A3:</b> Fluids are chosen based on boiling point, thermal stability, environmental impact, and availability. Ammonia and R-134a are common choices due to low boiling temperatures and efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Q4:</b> How can OTEC systems be hybridized for higher viability?<br>
          <b>A4:</b> By coupling with desalination plants, aquaculture cooling systems, or hydrogen production units, OTEC can provide multiple outputs—electricity, freshwater, and cooling—enhancing overall efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Q5:</b> What are the long-term environmental impacts of large-scale OTEC deployment?<br>
          <b>A5:</b> While generally low, possible impacts include changes in local marine temperature and nutrient mixing. Careful outflow management and environmental monitoring minimize these risks.
        </li>
