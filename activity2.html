    <p>
        Biogas production is a sustainable method of converting organic waste into renewable energy through anaerobic digestion. The diagram shows the working of a <b>biogas plant</b> designed for a dairy farm handling cattle waste. Organic waste, such as dung and slurry, is fed into a <b>mixing pit</b> and then sent into <b>digester tanks</b> where bacteria decompose the biomass in the absence of oxygen, producing a mixture of methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).
    </p>
        
    <p>
        <b>Working Process:</b> The produced biogas is collected at the top of the digester and can be used for electricity generation, heating, or cooking. The remaining slurry, called <b>fermentation residue</b>, serves as a nutrient-rich fertilizer. Heat exchangers maintain optimal temperatures inside the digester to ensure efficient microbial activity.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        <b>Advantages:</b> Reduces dependence on fossil fuels, converts waste to energy, provides organic fertilizer, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. <br>
        <b>Disadvantages:</b> Requires constant feedstock supply, moderate setup costs, and proper temperature control for efficiency.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        <b>Site Selection Criteria:</b> Availability of biomass (animal dung, agricultural residues, food waste), water, and suitable land. Proximity to power distribution or consumption points enhances viability.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        <b>Applications:</b> Biogas plants are widely used in rural areas for household energy, electricity generation for farms, and powering small industries. Large-scale systems contribute to municipal waste management and decentralized power generation.
    </p>
    <h3>Challenging Questions & Answers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Q1:</b> What parameters most significantly affect methane yield during anaerobic digestion?<br>
    <b>A1:</b> Temperature, pH (optimal 6.8–7.5), C/N ratio (ideal 25–30:1), and retention time strongly influence methane yield. Maintaining mesophilic (35–37°C) conditions ensures stable gas production.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Q2:</b> How does the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio affect efficiency?<br>
    <b>A2:</b> An imbalanced C/N ratio leads to process inhibition—too much carbon slows digestion, while excess nitrogen causes ammonia toxicity. Proper feedstock mixing maintains equilibrium for optimal microbial activity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Q3:</b> What are the challenges in scaling biogas systems to community levels?<br>
    <b>A3:</b> Issues include high setup cost, irregular feedstock supply, and maintenance challenges. Community-level management, feedstock collection logistics, and government support can overcome these.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Q4:</b> How can slurry byproduct improve agriculture?<br>
    <b>A4:</b> The digested slurry is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, enhancing soil fertility. It also reduces dependence on chemical fertilizers and improves crop yield sustainably.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Q5:</b> What innovations can improve gas purification and compression?<br>
    <b>A5:</b> Advanced scrubbing with zeolites or membranes, pressure swing adsorption, and compact gas storage systems can make purified biogas (bio-CNG) more efficient and economical.
  </li>
