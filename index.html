    <h1>Clean and Green Energy Portfolio - 21EEO307T</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio website created as part of the course <b>CLEAN AND GREEN ENERGY (21EEO307T)</b> under the guidance of <b>Dr.J.Divya Navamani</b>. This website presents three design-based activities focused on sustainable and renewable energy systems, developed to demonstrate the practical application of clean energy technologies. Each activity includes a complete system architecture, descriptive explanation, and insights into the energy conversion process, output utilization, and real-world significance.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As the global demand for energy continues to rise, clean energy sources like tidal, biomass, and ocean thermal energy provide sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. The primary objective of this portfolio is to explore the working principles, design considerations, and benefits of these renewable energy systems while emphasizing environmental responsibility and long-term feasibility.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This project is presented by <b>SUMANTH R</b> (<b>Register No:</b> RA2311026010861), a student of <b>B.Tech – Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning)</b> at <b>SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur</b>. Through this portfolio, I aim to showcase my understanding of various clean energy technologies and how they contribute to a greener future.

        <p>
        Use the navigation panel on the left to explore the following activities:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><b>Activity 1:</b> Design of a Tidal Energy Power Generation System</li>
          <li><b>Activity 2:</b> Biomass-Based Biogas Production System</li>
          <li><b>Activity 3:</b> Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) System</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        Each section contains a detailed block diagram, system explanation, and critical aspects such as advantages, disadvantages, site selection, real-world applications and challening questions with its answers. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how renewable energy systems function and how they can be integrated to create a sustainable future for our planet.
